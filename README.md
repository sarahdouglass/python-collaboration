This project is meant to help the programmer better understand the uses and implementations of classes in Python, specifically, the use of methods within a class. Students were asked to create an encompassing class with ten class methods used to answer ten separate problems, all relating to math operations and simple tasks. Instructions are inclusive in the program but, simple direction on how to use it would include following along with the instructions displayed on the screen by choosing to participate and entering the number of the task they would wish to complete. They would then have to enter the prompted information and watch as the program completes the task/operation and asks them if they would wish to complete another. If they indicate 'N' the program would end and if they indicate 'Y' the program would continue until they decide they have had enough and indicate 'N'.
